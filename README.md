# Java-Applications-Encryption-Decryption
Encryption and security
Utilising existing java file and buffer libraries, this java application offers encryption of high density cipher password. Virtually every type of file is supported by this application.
Decryption takes the cipher password and decrypts the file. I tried to make a time based file destroyer once the file is decrypted but it was left in the dust due to my freelancing ventures.
